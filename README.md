# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems. It serves as a collection of my coding practice, algorithmic implementations, and problem-solving approaches.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different branches, each representing a specific platform or problem set. The main branch primarily focuses on problems from GeeksforGeeks (GFG), while other branches consist of problems from various other platforms.

- `main` branch:
  - Contains problems from GeeksforGeeks (GFG)
  - Solutions are typically provided in cpp programming language

- Other branches:
  - Represent different platforms or problem sets (e.g., CSES problem set, Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)
  - Each branch may have its own folder structure or organization based on the platform's guidelines or contest structure


## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are not open to the public since it's a personal collection of solutions. However, if you spot any issues with the existing solutions or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me.

## License

The code and solutions in this repository are provided for educational purposes and personal development. You are free to use them as a reference or for learning purposes. However, please note that some problem platforms might have their own policies regarding sharing code and solutions, so ensure you adhere to their terms and conditions.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the various platforms and online judges for providing challenging problem sets and a platform for competitive programming practice. Additionally, I would like to thank the coding community for sharing their knowledge and insights, which have greatly contributed to my growth as a programmer.

Happy coding!
